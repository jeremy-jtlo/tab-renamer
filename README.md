# tab-renamer
A first attempt at developing and using Firefox WebExtensions using background scripts free of UI.

## How to use
1. Clone/download this repo to your PC
2. Start Firefox
3. Go to `about:debugging` and click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
4. Select the folder where this repo has been saved, open it

## Saving Tabs as files
This plugin is primarily for saving images. Once it's been loaded, select the tabs with the content you want to save, and select "Save Tabs in Sequence".

That will start the Firefox download flow, whether files automatically go to your Downloads folder or not is determined by the browser settings.
